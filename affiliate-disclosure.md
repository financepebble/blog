# Affiliate Disclosure

**Transparency matters to us.**

## How Affiliate Links Work

FinancePebble participates in affiliate marketing programs. When you click certain links and make a purchase or sign up for a service, we may earn a commission **at no extra cost to you**.

Here's how it works:
1. You click a link to a product or service
2. You complete a purchase or sign up
3. The company pays us a small commission
4. **You pay the same price** you would have paid anyway

## Our Promise to You

### We Only Recommend What We Believe In
We never recommend products solely for high commissions. Our recommendations are based on quality, value, and relevance to your financial goals.

### Honest Reviews
Affiliate relationships don't influence our content. If a product has flaws, we'll tell you. If a competitor offers better value, we'll mention it.

### We Provide Context
When recommending products, we explain why, highlight pros and cons, compare alternatives, and give you enough information to decide for yourself.

## What We Promote

We may earn commissions from:
- Credit card issuers
- Financial services (investment platforms, banking, insurance)
- Retail products and services
- Travel services (hotels, airlines, booking sites)
- Software and tools (financial calculators, budgeting apps)

## FTC Compliance

This disclosure complies with the Federal Trade Commission's [16 CFR, Part 255](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/guides-concerning-use-endorsements-testimonials-advertising).

## Not Everything Is Affiliate Content

Much of our content has no affiliate links:
- Educational articles
- Free calculators and tools
- General financial advice
- News and market updates

Our goal is value first, with affiliate partnerships as a secondary benefit that helps us create quality content.

## Your Trust Matters

We built FinancePebble to help people make smarter financial decisions. That only works if you trust us.

If our affiliate relationships ever compromise our content quality or honesty, please [let us know](/contact/).

## Questions?

[Contact us](/contact/) anytime.
