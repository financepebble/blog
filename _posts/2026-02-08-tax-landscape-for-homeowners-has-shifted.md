## 14 Tax Deductions & Benefits for Homeowners Under the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB)

If you own a home—or you're thinking about buying one—the tax landscape just got a whole lot more interesting. The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB)**, signed into law on **July 4, 2025**, brought some of the most significant changes to homeownership in decades. [1]

As we move through the **2026 tax year**, it’s time to stop thinking of these changes as "new" and start putting them to work. For many of you in the 40-60 age bracket, these rules aren't just about filing; they are critical tools for your retirement planning.

### 1. The Mortgage Interest Deduction: Now Permanent

The OBBB has finally ended the "will they/won't they" uncertainty regarding interest caps. [2]

* **The Cap:** The **$750,000** limit on mortgage debt (for loans after Dec 15, 2017) is now permanent. It was scheduled to revert to $1 million in 2026, but the new law locked the lower cap in place.
* **Grandfather Clause:** If you bought your home before that 2017 date, you remain at the **$1 million** limit.
* **Pro Tip:** This applies to your primary residence and **one** additional home. If you're looking at a retirement condo in Florida, that interest counts too!

### 2. Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI): A Major 2026 Win

This is the "Year of the PMI." Starting in **2026**, PMI premiums are officially treated as deductible mortgage interest again. [3]

* **Phaseout:** This starts at an Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) of **$100,000**.
* **The Math:** For every $1,000 you earn over that limit, you lose 10% of the deduction. It’s gone once you hit **$109,000**.
* **Action Step:** Check your monthly statements. If you're paying $150/month, that’s an $1,800 deduction you need to track for your 2026 return.

### 3. The SALT Deduction: A Massive $40,400 Cap

This is arguably the crown jewel of the OBBB for high-tax state residents. The old $10,000 "SALT cap" is gone. [4]

| Tax Year | SALT Cap (Joint Filers) | Threshold for Phase-down (MAGI) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2025 | $40,000 | $500,000 |
| **2026** | **$40,400** | **$505,000** |
| 2027 | $40,804 | $510,050 |

> **The "Cliff" Note:** If your MAGI exceeds $505,000 in 2026, the deduction is reduced by 30% of the amount over that threshold, though it will never drop below the old $10,000 baseline. [4]

### 4. Mortgage Discount Points: Still Deductible

Points are essentially "prepaid interest." In 2026, with interest rates remaining a primary concern for buyers, paying points to "buy down the rate" remains a savvy move because they are still **fully deductible** in the year you pay them (for primary residences). [2]

### 5. Home Equity Loans and HELOCs

The rules remain strict: **interest is only deductible if the money is used to improve the home.**

* ✅ **Yes:** Kitchen remodel, new roof, or adding an ADU.
* ❌ **No:** Consolidating credit card debt or buying a boat.

### 6. Senior Bonus Deduction: The "Parent Strategy"

This new $6,000 deduction ($12,000 for couples) is a game-changer for those **65 or older**. [5]

* **Eligibility:** You must turn 65 by December 31, 2026.
* **The Strategy:** If you are in the "sandwich generation" supporting an aging parent, or if you are 65+ yourself, this is an **above-the-line deduction**. You get it even if you don't itemize! [6]

### 7. HOA Fees: Still a "No"

Unfortunately, the OBBB didn't budge here. HOA fees for your primary residence are **not** deductible. However, if you have a qualified **home office**, you can deduct a percentage of them!

### 8. Energy Efficiency Credits: The "2025 Look-Back"

**Important Timing Note:** The OBBB set a "sunset" for green energy credits on **December 31, 2025**. [7]

* **Installing in 2026?** Under current law, new 2026 installations do not qualify for the 30% credit.
* **Filing Now?** If you are currently filing your **2025 taxes**, this is your last chance to claim the **Residential Clean Energy Credit** (Section 25D) for that solar or heat pump project.

### 9. Home Office Deduction: Exclusively for the Self-Employed

W-2 employees are still left out in the cold. Only those with **Schedule C** income can claim this. If you’re a "solopreneur" using a 200 sq. ft. room, the simplified method gives you a flat **$1,000** deduction ($5/sq ft). [8]

### 10. Capital Gains Exclusion: $500,000 Tax-Free

This remains the most powerful wealth-building tool in the code. If you’ve lived in your home for 2 of the last 5 years, up to **$500,000** of profit (joint) is invisible to the IRS. [9]

### 11. Casualty Loss Deduction: Expanded for 2026

Starting in **2026**, you can deduct losses from **State-Declared Disasters** (ordered by a Governor), not just Federal ones. [10]

* **The Catch:** **Theft is still NOT deductible.** The OBBB maintained the ban on deducting losses from burglary or standard accidents.

### 12. Medical Home Improvements

If you’re modifying your home for "aging in place" (ramps, widening doors), these costs are deductible to the extent they exceed **7.5% of your AGI.** [11]

### 13. Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC)

This is a **dollar-for-dollar credit** of up to **$2,000/year**. If your state offers this and you qualify as a first-time or moderate-income buyer, it’s a direct reduction of your tax bill. [12]

### 14. Moving Expenses: Expanded for Intel

The moving deduction remains closed for most, but the OBBB expanded it in **2026** to include members of the **U.S. Intelligence Community** moving under official orders. [13]

### Should You Itemize or Take the Standard Deduction?

The **Standard Deduction** for 2026 has been adjusted for inflation: [14]

* **Single:** $16,100
* **Married Filing Jointly:** $32,200
* **Head of Household:** $24,150

**The 2026 Reality:** Because the **SALT cap** is now **$40,400**, many homeowners who previously took the standard deduction will find that **itemizing** is now the winning strategy.
