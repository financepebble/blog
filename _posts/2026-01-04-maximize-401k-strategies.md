Maximizing your 401(k) is one of the most powerful steps you can take toward financial independence. With contribution limits increasing in 2026, now is the perfect time to optimize your retirement strategy.

## 1. Maximize Your Employer Match

The employer match is essentially free money. If your company offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to capture the full amount.

**Example:** If your employer matches 100% on the first 6% of your salary:
- Salary: $75,000
- Your contribution: $4,500 (6%)
- Employer match: $4,500
- **Total: $9,000 in retirement savings**

Don't leave this money on the table!

## 2. Contribute the Maximum Allowed

For 2026, the 401(k) contribution limit is **$23,000** for those under 50, and **$30,500** for those 50 and older (including catch-up contributions).

### Why Max Out?

- **Tax advantages**: Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income
- **Compound growth**: More contributions = more time for compound interest to work
- **Reach FIRE faster**: Higher savings rate accelerates financial independence

## 3. Consider Roth 401(k) Contributions

If your employer offers a Roth 401(k) option, consider splitting your contributions between traditional and Roth accounts.

**Roth 401(k) benefits:**
- Tax-free withdrawals in retirement
- No required minimum distributions (RMDs) during your lifetime
- Diversifies your tax strategy

**Best for:** Young professionals or those expecting higher income in retirement.

## 4. Review Your Investment Allocation

Don't just set it and forget it. Review your 401(k) investments at least annually.

**Key considerations:**
- **Age-appropriate risk**: Younger investors can handle more stocks
- **Low-cost index funds**: Look for expense ratios under 0.20%
- **Diversification**: Don't put all eggs in one basket
- **Target-date funds**: Good "set it and forget it" option

## 5. Increase Contributions with Raises

Every time you get a raise, increase your 401(k) contribution by at least half the raise amount.

**Example:**
- Current salary: $60,000 (10% contribution = $6,000)
- New salary after 5% raise: $63,000
- Increase contribution to 12.5%: $7,875
- You barely notice the difference in take-home pay, but retirement savings jump by 31%!

## The Bottom Line

Your 401(k) is one of your most powerful wealth-building tools. By maximizing contributions, capturing the employer match, and optimizing your investment strategy, you're setting yourself up for a secure and potentially early retirement.

**Action Steps:**
1. Check your current contribution rate
2. Ensure you're getting the full employer match
3. Review your investment allocation
4. Set up automatic contribution increases
5. Consider Roth vs. traditional based on your situation

Start today—your future self will thank you!
