I've been thinking about morning routines lately. Many people say you need to wake up at 5am to be successful, but I'm not sure that's true for everyone.

Here's what I've learned from trying different approaches. Some people are natural early birds and others work better later in the day. The key is finding what works for you.

I tried waking up at 5am for a month. It was tough at first but I got used to it. The quiet morning hours were nice for focusing on work without distractions.

However, I also noticed I was more tired in the evenings. Eventually I found a balance that works better for me, waking up around 6:30am instead.

What's your morning routine like? Everyone is different and that's okay.
