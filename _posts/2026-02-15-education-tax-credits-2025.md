You're filing your **2025 tax return** right now. If anyone in your household paid tuition, carried student loans, or has kids in school, there's a real chance the IRS has money set aside for you that you haven't claimed yet.

Education tax benefits are consistently among the most underused in the entire tax code — not because they're obscure, but because the rules have just enough nuance to trip people up. Let's walk through every major credit, deduction, and strategy in plain English — including what the **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)**, signed July 4, 2025, changed that applies to your **2025 return right now**.

## The Two Big Education Credits: Know Which One Is Yours

You can only claim **one** of these per student per year — not both. Choosing correctly matters more than most people realize.

### American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)

This is the headliner. The AOTC is worth up to **$2,500 per student** — calculated as 100% of the first $2,000 in qualifying expenses plus 25% of the next $2,000. It covers tuition, required fees, and — the part people most often miss — **books, supplies, and required equipment** purchased anywhere, not just from the school bookstore. <sup>[1]</sup>

**Key eligibility rules for 2025:**
- The student must be in their **first four years** of postsecondary education
- They must be enrolled **at least half-time for at least one academic period that began in 2025** — a single semester or quarter qualifies; the student does not need to be enrolled the full year <sup>[1]</sup>
- No felony drug conviction as of December 31, 2025
- The credit cannot have been claimed for that student in four or more prior tax years

The AOTC's biggest advantage: it's **partially refundable** — 40% of whatever credit remains after zeroing out your tax bill comes back as cash, up to **$1,000**. That's real money even for lower-income earners. <sup>[1]</sup>

**New for 2025 — OBBBA SSN Requirement:** The OBBBA added a stricter identification rule. Your return must now include your own valid **Social Security Number**, the student's valid SSN, and the school's **Employer Identification Number (EIN)**. The IRS can automatically disallow the credit if any of these are missing — no audit needed. All three appear on your **Form 1098-T**. <sup>[2]</sup>

**2025 AOTC Income Limits (MAGI):**

| Filing Status | Full Credit | Partial Credit | No Credit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single / Head of Household | ≤ $80,000 | $80,001 – $89,999 | ≥ $90,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | ≤ $160,000 | $160,001 – $179,999 | ≥ $180,000 |

*Source: IRS Form 8863 Instructions (2025)* <sup>[1]</sup>

> **Mentor tip:** These limits are based on your *Modified* AGI — not the raw number at the top of your 1040. IRA contributions, student loan interest, and other items get added *back* into MAGI. Run that calculation before assuming you're out of range.

---

### Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC)

The LLC is quieter but more flexible. It's worth up to **$2,000 per tax return** — 20% of the first $10,000 in qualified expenses — covering graduate school, part-time courses, professional development, and job-skills classes with **no limit on the number of years** you can claim it. <sup>[3]</sup>

The income phaseouts are identical to the AOTC: full credit below $80,000 MAGI for single filers ($160,000 MFJ), phasing out completely at $90,000 ($180,000 MFJ). Key differences from the AOTC: the LLC is **non-refundable** (reduces your tax to zero but generates no cash refund), and it covers **only tuition and required fees billed by the school** — books and supplies don't count here. <sup>[3]</sup>

Unlike the AOTC, the LLC has **no half-time enrollment requirement** and no felony drug conviction restriction, making it suitable for a much broader range of learners.

> **Mentor tip:** Grad student? Taking professional courses while working full-time? The LLC is your credit. The AOTC simply isn't available beyond four undergraduate years.

## Student Loan Interest Deduction

If you made student loan payments in 2025, you can deduct **up to $2,500** in interest without itemizing. It's an above-the-line deduction that reduces your adjusted gross income directly on Schedule 1. <sup>[4]</sup>

The 2025 income thresholds moved up from last year — if you were just over the edge on your 2024 return, run the numbers again:

**2025 Student Loan Interest Income Limits (MAGI):**

| Filing Status | Full Deduction | Phase-Out Range | No Deduction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single / Head of Household | < $85,000 | $85,000 – $99,999 | ≥ $100,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | < $170,000 | $170,000 – $199,999 | ≥ $200,000 |

*Source: IRS Publication 970 (2025)* <sup>[4]</sup>

Check your mailbox for **Form 1098-E** from your servicer if you paid $600 or more in interest. One firm rule: **married filing separately** cannot claim this deduction at all — explicitly excluded regardless of income. <sup>[4]</sup>

---

## Other Benefits Worth Knowing

**Employer Tuition Assistance — $5,250 Exclusion**
If your employer pays for your education, up to **$5,250 per year** is excluded from your gross income under Section 127 — it won't appear as wages on your W-2. The OBBBA permanently extended employer student loan repayment assistance under this same provision as of July 4, 2025. <sup>[5]</sup>

**Educator Expense Deduction — For K–12 Teachers**
Eligible K–12 teachers, counselors, and staff who work at least 900 hours during the year can deduct **up to $300** in unreimbursed classroom expenses without itemizing. Married educators filing jointly can each claim $300 for a combined max of **$600**. Covers supplies, books, software, and professional development courses. <sup>[6]</sup>

> **Note:** The OBBBA created an expanded unlimited itemized deduction for educators, but that starts with **tax year 2026** — not applicable to your current return.

## 529 Plan OBBBA Changes: What Applies Right Now vs. Next Year

This is where most people — and even some tax software — get confused. The OBBBA made several 529 changes with *different* effective dates:

| 529 Change | On Your 2025 Return? | Effective |
|---|---|---|
| Expanded K-12 expenses: tutoring (unrelated tutor), curriculum materials, SAT/ACT/AP fees, dual-enrollment costs, disability educational therapies | **Yes ✅** | July 5, 2025 |
| Postsecondary credentialing: vocational programs, trade certifications, CDL, HVAC, CPA/bar exam prep | **Yes ✅** | July 5, 2025 |
| K-12 annual withdrawal cap increase: $10,000 → $20,000 | **No ❌** | Tax Year 2026 |
| 529-to-ABLE rollovers made permanent | **No ❌** | After Dec 31, 2025 |

*Sources: BlackRock, John Hancock, WesternCPE, IRS Pub 970 (2025)* <sup>[7][8][9]</sup>

The expanded *categories* of qualifying expenses are live on your 2025 return. The higher *dollar cap* for K-12 doesn't arrive until next year. These two things travel together in every headline but have different effective dates — stay alert to that distinction.

**Coordination warning:** You cannot use the same dollar of qualified expenses for both a tax-free 529 withdrawal *and* an education credit. If you mixed 529 funds with out-of-pocket payments this year, know which dollars came from which source before you file.

> **State warning:** California, New York, and several other states have not yet conformed to the OBBBA's expanded 529 expense definitions. Check your state before assuming a state tax benefit follows federal treatment. <sup>[9]</sup>

## New for 2025: Trump Accounts

The OBBBA created a new savings vehicle officially called **Trump accounts** (also known as MAGA accounts — Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement). If your child was born after December 31, 2024 and before January 1, 2029, you may be eligible to claim a **$1,000 federal seed contribution** by filing **Form 4547** with your 2025 return. <sup>[10]</sup>

Be clear-eyed about what this is: contributions up to $5,000 annually are after-tax, and earnings are **tax-deferred — not tax-free**. Growth is taxed at long-term capital gains rates on qualified withdrawal. For dedicated education savings, a 529 plan's fully tax-free growth still has the edge. But the free $1,000 seed for a qualifying newborn is worth claiming if your child is eligible. <sup>[10]</sup>

---

## Common Mistakes That Cost People Money

**Double-dipping on 529s and education credits.** You cannot use the same tuition dollars for both a tax-free 529 withdrawal and an education credit. Use out-of-pocket dollars for the AOTC and 529 funds for the remainder.

**Missing SSN or EIN on Form 8863.** Under new OBBBA rules, your SSN, the student's SSN, and the school's EIN must all appear on Form 8863. IRS auto-disallows without them. Find all three on your Form 1098-T. <sup>[1][2]</sup>

**Assuming parents must claim the credit.** If a college student files independently and isn't claimed as a dependent, they can claim the AOTC themselves — even if parents paid the tuition. A powerful workaround when parents earn above the income limit.

**The kiddie tax trap.** Full-time students under 24 who are claimed as dependents and earn less than half their own support lose the **refundable** portion of the AOTC entirely. They can still claim the nonrefundable portion — but won't receive cash back. <sup>[1]</sup>

## Your Pre-Filing Checklist

1. **Pull Form 1098-T** from your school's portal — required for education credits; contains the school's EIN.
2. **Pull Form 1098-E** from your loan servicer if you paid student loan interest in 2025.
3. **Calculate your MAGI**, not just gross income — several items get added back in.
4. **Map which dollars paid which expenses** if you mixed 529 withdrawals with out-of-pocket cash.
5. **Check your state's 529 conformity** to OBBBA changes before counting on a state deduction.
6. **Had a baby in 2025?** File Form 4547 with your return to claim the $1,000 Trump account seed.
