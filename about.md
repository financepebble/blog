# About FinancePebble

Welcome to FinancePebble—your trusted portal for smart money decisions.

## Our Mission

FinancePebble exists to help people aged 30 and beyond make informed financial decisions that lead to greater freedom, security, and lifestyle flexibility.

- **Multi-topic coverage** from retirement planning to travel hacking
- **Daily updates** on deals, credit card bonuses, and financial news
- **Free calculators and tools** to help you make informed decisions
- **No-nonsense approach** to personal finance

## Disclaimer

FinancePebble provides general financial information for educational purposes only. Nothing on this site should be considered professional financial, tax, or legal advice. Financial situations are unique—always consult with qualified professionals (CFP, CPA, attorney) for personalized guidance.

Credit card offers, travel deals, and market information change frequently. While we strive for accuracy, always verify details directly with service providers before making decisions.
